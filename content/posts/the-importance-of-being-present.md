Be present.

We’ve all been subject to endless mumbo jumbo about living in the present.  While there’s valuable signal and distracting noise in the copious messages bombarding the media in our lives, my post today is not about this generally.

By and large I am a consultant.  Working for a software provider, I support customers in their adoption of our technology.  I am an engineer by background, both systems and software, but at times you wouldn’t know it by how many meetings I attend.  One might argue that meetings dominate my days by over 75% on average.

The unfortunate part about all this is that it isn’t because of some move into leadership or management.  No, the nature of consulting with customers means that I am meeting with personnel at all levels within an organization from high level strategy and business needs to low level implementation, and I still have to find time to retain my “hands on keyboard” acumen or woe be to those who follow my recommendations.  I have to speak across the IT organization simultaneously at times, and that can be where the challenge is.

See, there is no meeting that I have that is not important.  Let me repeat that: There is no meeting that is not important.

I’ll save you some wind by adding the subtle disclaimer that this doesn’t necessarily apply to internal meetings, but my overarching messaging here applies to those as well.

But when it comes to customers, they are all important.  My customers, your customers, our partners in our journey to making IT work more awesome are all taking valuable time out of their day to solve problems.  They ask for my time, and I believe the least I can do for them is to bring all I have and all I can of myself to those meetings.

I’ll be first in line for the shame-fest admitting that I have taken copious conference calls where I was front-and-center with a client from the back of a Lyft or an Uber.  I’m not proud of it, and my goal is to be much more mindful about how I plan my schedule to accommodate for things like travel.  Getting to the hotel an hour later because I sat down at my arrival airport to use the Wi-Fi is worth it to those people who are also giving me their time.  It’s the least I can do.

So Being Present may also apply to relationships with your spouse, your children, your friends, your pets or anyone who deserves all of you when you give them your time, but this was meant to be a specific callout to the types of work I do and many of my readers also do.

Thus, Be Present.
